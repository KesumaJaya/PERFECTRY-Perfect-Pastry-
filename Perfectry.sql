Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. *If you don’t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.\r\n\r\nstep 2\r\nAdd the flour, brown sugar, and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.\r\n\r\nstep 3\r\nKnead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 6-7 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 6-7 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test.\r\n\r\nLightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.  Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.\r\nLine two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\r\n\r\nShape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it—doesn’t need to be perfect!) Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 – 2 inches in diameter. Watch video below for a visual. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.\r\nPreheat oven to 425°F (218°C).\r\n\r\nWater bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in the honey. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop bagels in, 2-4 at a time, making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels for 1 minute on each side.\r\nUsing a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. Place 4 bagels onto each lined baking sheet.\r\n\r\nBake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be a dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.\r\n\r\nSlice, toast, top, whatever you want! Cover leftover bagels tightly and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.', 1),

Add the cream cheese, then beat the two until smooth. Get all the cream cheese lumps out. Beat in the sugar, then add the sour cream and vanilla. So far there’s been a lot of mixing and that’s ok!\r\n\r\n1 egg at a time: Add the eggs 1 at a time, making sure each is incorporated before adding the next. When the eggs are room temperature, the mixer only needs a few turns and won’t over-mix them. \r\n\r\nOver-mixed batter = heavy-as-a-brick cake.\r\n\r\nAdd dry ingredients: Add the dry ingredients right into the same mixing bowl.\r\n\r\nPour into pan: Pour the batter into a generously greased 10-12 cup Bundt pan. This is totally not sponsored, but I absolutely adore Nordic Ware Bundt pans. Make sure you use one that holds 10-12 cups of batter. This one is also gorgeous! 🙂\r\n\r\nBake: Bake the cream cheese pound cake at 325°F (163°C).

These soft-baked thick and chunky cookies are as indulgent as they look: rich and fudge-like with chewy centers, slightly crisp edges, and oodles of melty chocolate chips in each glorious bite.\r\n\r\nIt’s the chocolate dough recipe I’ve been making for years and even included it in my cookbook stuffed with peanut butter cups. There’s no reason to stray from this basic chocolate dough!', 'Wet ingredients: Butter, white & brown sugars, egg, vanilla extract, and milk\r\n\r\nDry ingredients: Flour, unsweetened natural cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt', 'Preliminary note: This cookie dough requires at least 3 hours of chilling, but I prefer to chill the dough overnight. The colder the dough, the thicker the cookies.\r\n\r\nIn a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on medium high speed until fluffy and light in color, about 2-3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla extract, and then beat on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.\r\n\r\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt together until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour into the wet ingredients. Beat on low until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick. Switch to high speed and beat in the milk, then the chocolate chips. The cookie dough will be sticky and tacky. Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this sticky cookie dough.\r\n\r\nRemove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. This makes the chilled cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.\r\n\r\nPreheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.\r\n\r\nScoop and roll dough, a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons (about 35-40g; I like to use this medium cookie scoop) in size, into balls. To ensure a thicker cookie, make the balls taller than they are wide (almost like a cylinder or column). Arrange 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets. The cookie dough is certainly sticky, so wipe your hands clean after every few balls of dough you shape.\r\n\r\nBake the cookies for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set and the centers still look soft. Tip: If they aren’t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven to continue baking.\r\n\r\nCool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. During this time, I like to press a few more chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. (This is optional and only for looks.) Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely. The cookies will slightly deflate as they cool. \r\n\r\nCover leftover cookies tightly and store at room temperature for up to 1 week.', 1),

Place cranberries in a large heatproof bowl. Set aside. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, bring the water and 3/4 cup (150g) of sugar to a simmer, whisking until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Pour the sugar syrup over the cranberries and stir. Cover the bowl and set aside for 15 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cranberries from the sugar syrup and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Allow to dry, uncovered, for 1 hour. \r\n\r\nPour remaining 1/2 cup (100g) sugar into a large bowl. Toss the cranberries in the sugar, coating them all the way around. Place on a parchment paper- or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet and let them dry uncovered for at least 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. For more uses, see how to make sugared cranberries.\r\n\r\nMake the pie crust through step 5 according to my directions and video tutorial in my pie crust recipe. Or use your favorite pie dough or store-bought.\r\nPreheat oven to 375°F (190°C).\r\n\r\nRoll out the chilled pie crust: Remove 1 disc of pie dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle. Make sure to turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls. Carefully place the dough into a 9×2-inch deep dish pie dish (this is the one I use; it is 1.75-inches deep). Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it’s tightly pressed into the pie dish. \r\n\r\nFold any dough overhang back into the dish to form a thick rim around the edges. Crimp the edges with a fork or flute the edges with your fingers. Review my how to crimp and flute pie crust tutorial if you need extra help with this step. Brush edges lightly with egg wash mixture.\r\n\r\nPar-bake the crust: Line the pie crust with parchment paper. Crunching up the parchment paper is helpful so that you can easily shape it into the crust. Fill with pie weights or dried beans. (Note that you will need at least 2 standard sets of pie weights to fit.) Make sure the weights/beans are evenly distributed around the pie dish. Par-bake the crust for 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nCarefully remove the parchment paper/pie weights. Prick the bottom of the crust all over with a fork to create steam vents and return crust (without weights) to the oven for 7-8 more minutes or until the bottom is *just* starting to brown. (Review this how to par-bake pie crust page if you need extra help with this par-baking step.)\r\n\r\nMake the pumpkin pie filling: Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, heavy cream, and milk. Vigorously whisk until everything is combined.\r\n\r\nPour pumpkin pie filling into the warm crust. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up. (If using a deep dish pie dish as instructed, you should only have a little filling leftover. Use extra to make mini pies with leftover pie dough scraps if you’d like.) Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the center will be wobbly—that’s ok. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown. Check for doneness at minute 50, and then 55, and then 60, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours before garnishing and serving.\r\n\r\nDecorate with sugared cranberries and pie crust leaves (see note). You’ll definitely have leftover cranberries… they’re tasty for snacking. Serve pie with whipped cream if desired.\r\n\r\nCover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.', 1),

Choose from a few easy icing flavors to top the warm & gooey rolls.\r\n\r\nThis recipe is brought to you in partnership with Red Star Yeast.', '\"Flour: Flour provides the dough structure. All-purpose flour is best for these cinnamon rolls. You could also use bread flour—the rolls will be chewier.\r\n\r\nSugar: You need white granulated sugar in the dough, both for flavor and to feed the yeast.\r\n\r\nSalt: Flavor.\r\n\r\nWhole milk: Whole milk is ideal for the richest-tasting cinnamon rolls. Buttermilk works just as well without any changes to the recipe. Many readers have successfully substituted nondairy milks. In a pinch, you can use low-fat milk, but avoid using nonfat milk.\r\n\r\nButter: This is a rich dough, meaning it has fat to help guarantee softness.\r\n\r\nEgg: Like butter, egg promises a softer, richer dough.', 'Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.\r\n\r\nCombine the milk and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (about 110°F/43°C, no higher). Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir with a sturdy rubber spatula or wooden spoon OR use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed. Mix until a soft dough forms.\r\n\r\nTransfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Using floured hands, knead the dough for 3-5 minutes. You should have a smooth ball of dough. If the dough is super soft or sticky, you can add a little more flour. Place in a lightly greased bowl (I use non-stick spray), cover loosely, and let the dough rest for about 10 minutes as you get the filling ingredients ready.\r\n\r\nFill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8-inch (36×20-cm) rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and brown sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough to make a 14-inch log. Cut into 10–12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9- or 10-inch round cake pan, pie dish, or square baking pan.\r\n\r\nRise: Cover the pan with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the rolls to rise in a relatively warm environment for 60–90 minutes or until double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)\r\n\r\nBake the rolls: After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 24–27 minutes, or until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking. If you want to be precise about their doneness, their internal temperature taken with an instant read thermometer should be around 195–200°F (91–93°C) when done. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. (You can also make the icing as the rolls bake.)\r\n\r\nMake the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add the butter and beat until smooth and combined, then beat in the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until combined. Using a knife or icing spatula, spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately. \r\n\r\nCover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.', 3),

They are usually served with a dusting of powdered sugar, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or syrup. The result is a soft, jiggly, melt-in-your-mouth pancake that’s both visually appealing and delicious.', '	•	2 large eggs (separate yolks and whites)\r\n	•	1/4 cup milk\r\n	•	1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n	•	1/4 cup all-purpose flour\r\n	•	1/2 teaspoon baking powder\r\n	•	2 tablespoons granulated sugar\r\n	•	Butter (for greasing the pan)\r\n	•	Powdered sugar, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or syrup (for serving)', '	1.	Separate the Eggs:\r\n	•	Carefully separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Place the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl and set aside.\r\n	2.	Mix the Batter:\r\n	•	In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract until well combined.\r\n	•	Sift in 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder into the egg yolk mixture. Mix until smooth and no lumps remain.\r\n	3.	Beat the Egg Whites:\r\n	•	Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the egg whites on medium speed until they start to become frothy. Add 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar (optional) to help stabilize the egg whites.\r\n	•	Gradually add 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar while continuing to beat the egg whites. Increase the speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form. The egg whites should be glossy and hold their shape.\r\n	4.	Fold the Egg Whites into the Batter:\r\n	•	Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture in three parts. Use a spatula to fold carefully, ensuring not to deflate the mixture. The batter should be light and airy.\r\n	5.	Cook the Pancakes:\r\n	•	Preheat a non-stick skillet over low heat and lightly grease it with butter.\r\n	•	Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, spoon the batter onto the skillet to form small mounds. You can use round molds to help the pancakes keep their shape if desired.\r\n	•	Cover the skillet with a lid and cook the pancakes on low heat for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Be patient, as cooking them slowly helps maintain their fluffy texture.\r\n	6.	Serve:\r\n	•	Carefully transfer the pancakes to a plate.\r\n	•	Serve the fluffy pancakes immediately, topped with powdered sugar, fresh fruits, whipped cream, or syrup.\r\n\r\nEnjoy your delicious Japanese fluffy pancakes', 5),

Like so many rustic bread recipes, it relies on just pantry staples of all-purpose flour, yeast, salt, and water. But what distinguishes this recipe, its true genius, is the technique. Theres no kneading required.', '> 3 cups lukewarm water (100°F or 38°C), plus more for the broiler tray\r\n> 1 tablespoon granulated yeast (active dry, instant, quick rise, or bread machine is fine)\r\n> 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher or other coarse salt, to taste\r\n> 6 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, measured by the scoop-and-sweep method\r\n> Cornmeal, for dusting (optional)', 'A) MAKE THE DOUGH\r\n1. Warm the 3 cups water just a little so that it feels just slightly warmer than body temperature. That should put it at about 100°F (40°C).\r\n2. In the large bowl of a standing mixer or a 6-quart container with a lid, mix the yeast, warm water, and salt. \r\n3. Add the flour to the yeast mixture all at once, then use a spoon or stand mixer to mix until the flour is completely incorporated and you have a blobby dough. (If you’re hand-mixing the dough and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon, just use very wet hands to press the mixture together.) \r\n4. Loosely cover the container and let the dough hang out at room temperature until it begins to rise and collapse or at least flatten a little on the top, about 2 hours.\r\nB) STASH THE DOUGH IN THE FRIDGE\r\n1. After 2 hours, stash the container of dough in the fridge. That\'s it. \r\n2. You can use the dough anytime after the initial 2-hour rise, although the refrigerated wet dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature, so its best to refrigerate the dough overnight before handling it. Once refrigerated, the dough will seem to have shrunk back upon itself as though it will never rise again—thats normal. Whatever you do, do not punch down this dough.\r\nC) SHAPE THE DOUGH INTO A LOAF\r\n1. When you want to bake a loaf of artisan bread, dust a pizza peel or a baking sheet turned upside down with cornmeal or line it with parchment paper.\r\n2. Grab a hunk of the dough and use a serrated knife or scissors to cut off about a 1-pound piece of dough. Hold the dough in your hands and, if necessary, add just enough flour so the dough doesnt stick to your hands. \r\n3. Gently stretch the surface of the dough, tucking the ends underneath the ball and rotating it a quarter turn as you go. The bottom of the ball of dough may appear to be a collection of bunched ends, but it will flatten out and adhere during resting and baking.\r\n4. Place the ball of dough on the prepared pizza peel or baking sheet, seam side down with all the collected bunched ends on the peel or board. Let it rest for about 40 minutes. \r\nD) BAKE THAT GORGEOUS-LOOKING LOAF\r\n1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C) for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat a baking stone (or an upside-down cast-iron skillet or baking sheet) on a middle rack for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Place an empty metal broiler tray on any rack that wont interfere with the rising bread. \r\n2. Dust the top of the raised loaf generously with flour and, using a serrated bread knife, slash a 1/2-inch-deep cross or a couple gashes or a tic-tac-toe pattern in the top. Theres no need to dust the flour off the loaf.', 8),

Pour the ½ cup warm water into a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top. Place the bowl in a warm place for about 10-15 minutes. Be patient! If yeast is activated, you will see foam on top of the mixture, and even a few small bubbles. Also, if you take sniff, it will smell very much like yeast.\r\n2. Gently stir in flour and salt.  Add the other cup of water and mix until just combined into a sticky, shaggy dough. Cover with a towel and let rest for 45 minutes.\r\n3. This step includes 4 repetitions of \"folding\" and \"resting\" for a total of 3 hours resting time: Instead of dusting your hands with flour, wet your hands with a little water and \"fold\" the dough: Leaving the dough in the bowl, stretch one side of the dough up and then over the top of the dough. Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat until you\'ve done each side. Flip the dough over, cover, and let rest another 45 minutes. Repeat this folding and resting process 3 more times.\r\n\r\nSHAPE THE DOUGH\r\n1. After the fourth resting period is done, take the dough out of the bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. If you have a scale, use it to weight each piece to make sure each is the same amount.\r\n2. Shape each piece into a rectangle and gently stretch out the ends. Cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.\r\n3. After resting, sprinkle each rectangle with a little bit of flour, a very light dusting so your hands don\'t stick. Fold each rectangle in half lengthwise and flip over seam side down. Gently roll each piece into a roughly 15 inch long log about 1 ½ inches in diameter. Gently stretch out the ends again and using your fingertips press them together into a point, forming the baguette shape.\r\n4. Gently move the baguettes onto a bakers couche or make your own using a lightly floured towel (I used a large tea towel): using the towel, create a ridge between each baguette (think taco stand). This will make sure the baguettes maintain their shape while you let them rest for the final time. Cover with an oiled piece of plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nBAKE THE BAGUETTES\r\n1. While the baguettes are resting, turn your oven on to preheat to 450˚F. During the last 10 minutes of rest time, place a pan on the bottom rack of the oven and fill with boiling water.\r\n2. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper. VERY carefully move each baguette on to the tray. Spray each baguette with a little water. Dust the tops lightly with flour. Score each one with 4 to 5 overlapping lines about ¼ inch deep.\r\n3. Being careful of the steam, open the oven and place the tray with the baguettes on the center rack. Spray  a little more water into the oven to make sure there is enough steam.\r\n4. Bake for 16-18 minutes, rotating the whole tray halfway through, until baguettes are a deep golden brown and sound hollow when the bottom is tapped.

I like doing this by hand and you can watch me in the video, or in my separate How to Knead Dough tutorial.\r\n2.Let the dough rise: Place dough into a greased bowl, cover tightly, then set aside to rise for about 2–3 hours.\r\n3.Flatten dough out onto a baking pan: Punch down the risen dough to release the air, then use your hands to flatten the dough out onto an oiled baking sheet. If the dough keeps shrinking, cover it for 5 minutes to let the gluten settle.\r\n4.Let the dough rest in the refrigerator: The cold temperature slows down the rising. In fact, there’s so little yeast that the dough will hardly rise at all during this step. Let it rest in the refrigerator for as little as 1 hour and up to 24 hours. The longer it rests, the better the flavor. I recommend at least 12 hours, just like with my artisan bread recipe. You won’t regret it!\r\n5.Remove from the refrigerator: Let the dough hang out on the counter as you preheat the oven and prep the toppings. It will rise a little bit, but not much.\r\nPreheat oven: Focaccia bakes in a very hot 450°F (232°C) oven.\r\n6.Dimple the dough: A good stress reliever! Use your fingers to dimple the entire surface of the dough just like we do when making veggie pizza. The dimples give the olive oil and toppings “a place to go.” This step is fun!\r\n7.Add toppings: A simple blend of fresh garlic, rosemary, thyme, and basil is a favorite, but I have plenty of focaccia topping suggestions listed below. No matter which topping you use, drizzle olive oil all over the surface.\r\n8.Bake: Bake until golden brown. I set the oven to broil for the last minute to really crisp up the surface. Highly recommended!', 6),

Preheat the oven to the temperature that your recipe recommends. Most fruit pies bake at a temperature between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Some recipes call for baking the pie in a 450 degree F oven to begin with, then turning down the oven to about 350 degrees F. This helps set the shape of the crust in recipes with a lot of fat; it can keep your crust from slouching.\r\n\r\n2. Brush the top crust with milk or lightly beaten egg before baking to add a richer color to a double-crust or lattice-topped pie. For more, check out How To Make A Lattice Pie Crust The Easy Way.\r\n\r\n3. Always bake pies on a baking sheet to prevent spillovers in the oven.\r\n\r\nA pie with a raw fruit filling will bake for about an hour. Berry, apple, and pear pies cook for about 45 minutes. When using a pre-cooked filling, pies can bake at a higher temperature for a shorter period of time, just enough to thoroughly bake the crust and heat the filling.\r\n\r\nTo check the doneness of the filling, insert a knife into the center of the pie. If it meets with little or no resistance, the pie is done. If the pie is not quite done but the top or edges are becoming too dark, loosely cover the top of the pie with aluminum foil to shield it from the heat. A glass pie dish is a great way to ensure the bottom crust is fully baked; using a baking stone or pizza stone is another trick. Baking on a stone ensures that the bottom crust on even the juiciest fruit pie will be done when the top is brown. Check out our step-by-step guide for How to Make a Pie Crust.\r\n\r\n4. Glaze the crust for shine and sparkle. Thin a quarter cup of light corn syrup with very hot water. When the pie is done, brush the thinned syrup over the top of the crust. You can add granulated sugar or decorative sugar at this time. Return the pie to the oven for two to three minutes to let the glaze dry and set. Once the pie is done baking, carefully remove it from the oven. Let the pie cool to room temperature before slicing to allow the filling to set.', 11),

Sorry!\r\nWhen separating the eggs, make sure that there is no yolk in the whites. If even a little yolk gets into the whites, the meringue will not whip properly because fat from the yolk prevents the eggs from bubbling up and forming foamy meringue.\r\nAdding cream of tartar to the egg whites stabilizes the eggs as they foam. While some French meringue recipes do not call for cream of tartar, I always opt to add it because meringue is not always stable.\r\nPipe the meringues onto a parchment-lined sheet pan. Dried meringue releases easily from parchment, but the cookies will not release as easily from Silpat or silicone mats.\r\nLeave the meringues in the oven for 1-2 hours after they are done baking. The diminishing heat allows the meringues to dry out without overcooking them.\r\nBlend the granulated sugar in a Blendtec or similar blender to turn the granulated sugar into superfine sugar. It will resemble powdered sugar after blending. I opt for this method over using regular powdered sugar because most powdered sugar found in stores contains cornstarch. Cornstarch leads to a chewy meringue, and we don’t want that.\r\nLastly, adding the sugar at the right time is key to getting the meringue texture just right! The sugar should not be added all at once, and timing is everything. Read on below for the sugar instructions.', 13);
